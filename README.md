# IMessageAnalyzer
This application requires you to obtain a .txt file using imessage-exporter.
See link -> [Download here](https://github.com/ReagentX/imessage-exporter)
Basically, Imessage-exporter can compile all the text messages you have linked on your Imessage account from your mac into handy .html or .txt files. My application will take the .txt file as input and will show data analytics for different keywords and such.

Initially devleloped to analyze texts between me and my girlfriend.
